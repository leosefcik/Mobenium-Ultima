# Mobenium Ultima

The ultimate Mobenium (game, not the resource)! A top-down 2D shooter with tanks and stuff.

## Description

A modern, better, cooler, fresher, hipper reimagining of the original [(Mobenium 2D on itch.io)](https://leosefcik.itch.io/mobenium-2d)!

**Mobenium Ultima** is the ultima... te top-down shooter.

It's a **multiplayer/singleplayer** experience with multiple gamemodes, from a pseudo-story waves gamemode where you fight off waves of bots to a classic deathmatch one where you fight off your friends. Maybe a battle royale mode too. idk

# Everything below this is WIP!

## Gamemodes

Currently, the planned gamemodes include:

### Waves

The OG gamemode, now with mutliplayer!

You and your trusty **tank** (and other people if present) are enjoying a nice evening in your new home. Destroyed and abandoned after the recent war between Soland and Ingor, you found a military base in the woods to repurpose and live in. It wasn't perfect, but it was far from civilization, free, and nobody cared.

However, this fragile peace wouldn't last for too long. Today, a surprise attack by the Ingor Republic broke the pact and sent both countries to war again. This means many things, but for you it means you're no longer safe.

Your base sits in a vulnerable position and will be taken over quickly with no time left for Soland to defend "their" territory. Recent technological advancements have allowed for the mass production of **cheap drone tanks**, which will swarm your base every night until it's finally conquered. It's time to restore the base to it's former glory.

Luckily, the cheap drone tanks drop a resource called **Mobenium** (chemical symbol Mb). A common resource, Mobenium is useful for the creation of various things, from household appliances to reinforced tank barrels.

You can **upgrade** your tank with the collected Mobenium and improve its abilities in many ways, with branching upgrades to spice things up on different playthroughs. Your ultimate goal is to fight off the last wave to get them to give up.

### Deathmatch

Fight your friends with your weapons of choice until the time runs out.
